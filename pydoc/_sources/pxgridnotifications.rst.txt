Enable Cisco pxGrid Notifications for DXL
=========================================

In order to allow the pxGrid examples to receive notifications, the
notifications must be enabled on the ePO server. The following steps walk
through the process for enabling notifications from the ePO web interface:

1. Navigate to **Server Settings** and select the **DXL Cisco pxGrid**
   setting on the left navigation bar.

3. Select the check box(es) for the notifications that DXL clients should be
   allowed to receive. To enable clients to receive all pxGrid notifications,
   select the ``All Notifications`` check box.

take several minutes to complete.
